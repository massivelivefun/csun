1.) What project did we end up implementing?

We made a contactless thermometer.

2.) How much of the project is working?

We have completed all of the deliverables stated in
the project proposal.

3.) What were the steps taken to implement and debug
    it? How long did it take?

The project is heavily in the same vein as Warmup
Project 2, where we were encouraged to program in a
specific event driven manner. Debugging the program was
easy since we used gdb. Also the program just did not
have any glaring bugs.

4.) What extra hardware was purchased.

We had to purchase an actual IR temperature reader to
have a component that would read the temperature from
objects in front of it.

5.) How many person hours did you spend?

It took about 48 hours to complete in a week’s time,
from November 10, 2020 to November 18, 2020.

6.) Which lines of code, that we did not make, we ended
    up using?

To actually interface with the thermometer we had to use
an external library that was made with the IR thermometer
itself. We basically only made function calls to that API.
I found this code through the manufacturer’s product page.
Otherwise all of the code in the project is 100% ours.
